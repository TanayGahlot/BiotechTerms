One example of this is the production of stress proteins or pathogenesis-related proteins when certain plants are attacked by certain pathogens.  Via such SAR response triggered by low-level fungal or viral infection, many plants successfully resist fungal/bacterial/viral attacks.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved one herbicide (COBRA<sup>TM</sup> owned by Valent Corp.), whose active ingredient is the chemical LACTOFIN, to be applied to soybean plants \"at or near bloom stage\" in order to trigger SAR against <b>white mold disease</b>.  In 2000, the American EPA approved harpin protein to be applied to some crops in order to trigger SAR against certain plant diseases. \n  \n\n", "linksFrom": ["Salicylic Acid (SA)", "Jasmonic Acid"], "linksTo": ["Fungus", "Immune Response", "Isoflavones", "Pathogen", "Soybean Plant", "Stress Proteins", "Virus", "Cascade", "Harpin", "Salicylic Acid (SA)", "Jasmonic Acid", "White Mold Disease", "Pathogenesis Related Proteins", "Phytoalexins", "R Genes"], "title": "Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) "}, {"definition": "See the link.\n\n", "linksFrom": [], "linksTo": ["Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR)"], "title": "Systematic Activated Resistance "}, {"definition": "Caterpillars (pupae) of the Lepidopteran insect <i>Pseudaletia unipuncta</i> species; most of which are harmful to crops (e.g., wheat, corn/maize, etc.) grown by humans.\n", "linksFrom": ["Cry Proteins", "Cry1A (b) Protein", "Cry9C Protein", "Volicitin", "Cry1F Protein", "Insect Cell Culture"], "linksTo": [], "title": "Armyworm "}, {"definition": "Latin name <i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> LeConte.
